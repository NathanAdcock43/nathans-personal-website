                Annotation station was created out of my need to organize everything that I was learning on YouTube.
                I found it difficult to remember where I had seen a coding method or tutorial, so I came up with a bookmarking
                application that organizes videos but also logs the moment of an important topic within a note that the user enters.
                Users look up their organized notes and click them to return to the related video and the moment the topic of interest
                is being discussed. It is a Full-stack application using MySQL, Java, Springboot w/ Jackson Data Binding on the back end
                and CSS, JavaScript and JQuery on the front. YouTubeâ€™s API was used for video information and thumbnails. Multiple types
                of users were included along with authentication and varied permissions.

                Built a marketplace for books using Java, MySQL, JavaScript, the google books API that included different
                user types. The application was styled using vanilla CSS featured elaborate page animations, eye catching graphics,
                and a custom logo created using the Adobe suite.
